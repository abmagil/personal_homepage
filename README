# Who is Aaron?

**I am, at my core, a builder.**

Every morning, I wake up inspired by the thought that I can, through hard work and insight, make the world better for real people by my actions.

To do this, I try to learn how the world works, using the highest granularity.  Initially, I lived this as a chemistry major and bench chemist, piecing atoms together to form drugs that treat anemia or coatings that improve diagnostics.  After I discovered software, the world it opened up to me was smaller still, but still revolved around mentally modeling systems, building those models, and tweaking them until they are better.  The biggest difference, to me, between chemistry and software is simply that the electrons move so much faster in the computer than in the beaker.

What I build is only useful insofar as it helps people.  I need the broadest understanding I can get of the problem before I start solving.  This need for user research is rooted in my time as a consultant, and before that, as a technical problem solver for hospital staff befuddled by their software.  These experiences helped me think pluralistically and empathize with my users.  Without speaking with users, I can't hope to know how the world works, nor can I hope to help them.

I believe the best products are built by teams, not lone-wolves.  I strive with every team I'm on to enrich the experience of my peers and enlarge their skillsets.  In so doing, I learn from them as well, letting a rising tide lift all boats.  I have been on many teams, both technical and athletic, going back to high school, in both leadership and support positions, and I have reaped the benefits of selflessness and teamwork.

Some developers are motivated by the code alone, and excel at churning out line after line.  I will never be one of those developers.  I aim to work with those developers, give them the tools they need to aim in the right direction and then let them loose on problems.
