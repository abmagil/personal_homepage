        <p>I have built and shipped services in Node and C#.NET</p>

          Services are usually hosted within AWS, primarily using ECS and Lambda

          I have built front-ends largely using React, as well as Backbone and
          vanilla JS.

          While the above reflects my existing experience, I pride myself on the
          ability to discern common patterns across frameworks and quickly learn
          the unique nuance of any given system. I believe in building products
          which solve problems for real users and prefer to build something
          quickly and iterate, regardless of tool..
